# Blog Post Website

A blog post website built with node.js, handlebars.js SQL, express, and sequelize.

### Description
The attached project file(s) are for our fourteenth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to a CMS-style blog post website, similar to a Wordpress site, where users can publish their blog posts and comment on others blog posts, as well. The application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure and uses handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

This project helped introduce me to the architectural rigor of the MVC paradigm, which organizes the front and backend into compartmentalized sections. Building the application in this way gave me perspective into how more robust applications are structured.


### Installation
In order to use the application, clone the GitHub repository link, use MySQL to create the database, use node ./seeds to seed the database, then run npm start to initialize the application.

### Usage
This application is free to use.

### Credits
This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors, TAs, and my tutor (Erik Hirsch) from UC Berkeley.
